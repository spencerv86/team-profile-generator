# The Team Profile Generator

## Description

The Team Profile Generator is a command line interface that was built through Test Driven Development and uses javascript and Node.js to dynamically create an aesthetically satisfying team-page for software engineering teams based on the data input by its user.

## Installation

Begin by forking the repository and downloading to your computer and make sure that you have node already installed. You may need to run 
```npm init``` or ```npm install``` but no other files should be necessary.

## Usage

To use the application, navigate into the repository in your terminal and run the following command:

``` node app.js ```

Answer the prompts as they appear in your terminal. After each employee has been added, you will have the option to finish or add another. There can only be one manager, but you can add as many engineers and interns as you would like. Once you have finished answering, a log should appear reading "Team page has been built". This new completed html page can be found under the 'output' folder in the file.
